# Dodo Nutrition — Project Handover Report

> **Last updated**: 2026-02-14
> **Owner**: Mohamed Ali Jardak (Dali)
> **Repo**: github.com/helix74/dodo-nutrition-ecommerce

---

## Project Overview

Dodo Nutrition is a **Tunisian sports nutrition e-commerce platform** built with:

- **Next.js 16.1.6** (App Router, Turbopack)
- **Sanity v4.22.0** (CMS — Studio mounted at `/studio`)
- **Clerk** (Authentication)
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui** (Styling)
- **GROQ AI** (AI shopping assistant)
- **Resend** (Email notifications)

### Language Strategy

- **Headlines & CTAs**: Darija in Arabic script (e.g., "علاش جاي؟", "واش مازلت محيّر؟")
- **Body text**: French
- **This mix is intentional** — do NOT normalize to pure French or Arabic

## Current State (Post Spec 018)

### What's Complete

| Spec | Feature | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| 001–007 | Core: cart, checkout (COD), product pages, UI unification | ✅ Done |
| 008 | Packs & Bundles (schema + queries ready, no data yet) | ✅ Schema done |
| 009 | Reviews system (schema, admin panel, testimonials, category reviews) | ✅ Done |
| 010 | Wishlist | ✅ Done |
| 011 | Email notifications (Resend) | ✅ Done |
| 012 | Enhancements | ✅ Done |
| 013 | UI design system | ✅ Done |
| 014 | Mega menu | ✅ Done |
| 015 | Homepage + shop improvements | ✅ Done |
| 016 | SEO optimization | ✅ Done |
| 017a–g | Homepage redesign (9-section architecture) | ✅ Done |
| **018** | **Dataset cleanup & product import** | ✅ Done |

### Database State (Sanity Production)

| Document Type | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Products | **119** | All clean, proper IDs, 0 broken refs |
| Categories | **10** | proteines, creatine, pre-workout, gainers, bruleurs, acides-amines, vitamines, boosters, barres-snacks, accessoires |
| Brands | **21** | All with ≥1 product |
| Hero Slides | 1 | Active |
| Banners | 3 | Active |
| Packs | 0 | Awaiting user data (template at `data/template-packs.csv`) |
| Reviews | 0 | Ready for input |
| Orders | 0 | Clean slate |

### What Still Needs User Action

1. **`data/products-database.csv`** — User needs to update real prices, stock, featured flags
2. **Product images** — Need manual upload in Sanity Studio
3. **Pack data** — User will provide CSV based on `data/template-packs.csv`

### Key Patterns

- **GROQ queries**: All use `defineQuery()` from `next-sanity`, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` naming
- **Product IDs**: `product-{brand-slug}-{product-slug}` (prevents collisions)
- **Category IDs**: `category-{slug}` (e.g., `category-proteines`)
- **Brand IDs**: `brand-{slug}` (e.g., `brand-applied-nutrition`)
- **Goal navigation**: Maps goal IDs to category slug arrays in `lib/constants/goals.ts`
- **Sanity fetch**: Always use `sanityFetch()` from `sanity/lib/live.ts` (not raw client.fetch)
- **Dark theme**: Uses CSS vars (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`, `bg-dodo-yellow` for CTAs)

### Known Non-Issues (Don't Try to Fix)

- `No serverToken provided to defineLive` — Warning only, published content works fine
- 4 TypeGen warnings on paginated queries (`slicing must use constant numbers`) — Expected, queries work at runtime
- `fetch failed` / `ConnectTimeoutError` — User has intermittent internet, not a code issue

---

## What's Next: Phase 3

The user wants to do a **front-end revision pass** — fixing visual bugs, styling issues, and UI polish across the site. This has NOT started yet.

Potential areas (user will specify):
- Homepage section visual refinements
- Product card improvements
- Shop page filter UI
- Product detail page layout
- Mobile responsiveness
- Color/typography consistency
- Empty states (no packs, no reviews, no images)

## Working With This Project

### Commands

```bash
pnpm dev              # Start dev server (Turbopack)
npx tsc --noEmit      # TypeScript check
npx sanity schema extract  # Extract Sanity schema
npx sanity typegen generate --enforce-required-fields  # Generate types
pnpm build            # Production build
```

### Environment

- Sanity Project: `tivydqqm` / dataset: `production`
- All env vars in `.env.local` (DO NOT commit)
- Admin auth: separate JWT system (not Clerk)

### Speckit Workflow

The user follows a "speckit" methodology:
- Each feature gets a `specs/NNN-feature-name/` folder
- Contains: `spec.md` (main), `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `verification.md`
- User calls the AI agent "Maestro" and expects structured, documented work
- User communicates in **Tunisian Darija** (mix of Arabic + French) — respond normally in English/French
- **Speckit skill**: Use the `speckit` skill (`.cursor/skills/speckit/SKILL.md`) for `/speckit.*` commands

### User Preferences

- Prefers comprehensive analysis before changes
- Wants explicit verification after each task
- Expects git commits with detailed messages
- Likes CSV exports for manual data review
- Values documentation (specs, plans, checklists)
