# Specification: Mega Menu Navigation

## Goal

Add hover-triggered mega menu dropdowns for Categories (text list) and Brands (logo grid) to the main site header.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to see all categories when hovering over "Nos Produits" so I can quickly navigate
- As a user, I want to see brand logos when hovering over "Marques" so I can browse by brand
- As a user, I want the mega menu to close smoothly when I move my mouse away

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Must work on desktop (hover) — mobile uses existing hamburger menu
- Smooth open/close transitions (no jarring jumps)
- Data fetched server-side for performance
