# UI Design Audit Implementation Plan

## Goal

Elevate the visual quality of Dodo Nutrition to a "Premium" and "Creative" standard.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Hero Section Overhaul

- **Current**: Standard slider.
- **Proposed**:
  - Add subtle entrance animations (Framer Motion or CSS).
  - Improve gradient overlays for better text readability.
  - Make CTA buttons more prominent.

### 2. Product Card Refinement

- **Current**: Functional but basic.
- **Proposed**:
  - "Quick View" on hover.
  - Smoother scale effects.
  - Better badge positioning (Promo, New).

### 3. Global Aesthetics

- **Colors**: Ensure `dodo-yellow` and `dodo-red` are used strategically as accents, not overwhelming.
- **Dark Mode**: Deepen blacks/grays for a sleek look (Zinc-950 vs Zinc-900).
- **Glassmorphism**: Add backdrop-blur to sticky headers and floating elements.

## Verification

- Manual visual inspection.
- User feedback loop.
