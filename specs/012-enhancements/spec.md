# Specification: Enhancements & Localization (I-Series)

## Goal

Improve accessibility and user flow through guest checkout, Darija translations, static pages, and social login configuration.

## User Stories

- As a guest, I want to checkout without creating an account (I1/I2)
- As a Tunisian user, I want to see key UI elements in Darija (I3)
- As a user, I want to access FAQ, shipping info, and terms pages (I4)
- As a user, I want to sign in with social accounts (I1 — Clerk config)

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Guest checkout must capture email for order notifications
- Darija translations use Arabic script for headlines/CTAs
- Static pages must be SEO-friendly with proper meta tags
